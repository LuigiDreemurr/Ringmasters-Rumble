There are two main types of settings you should be worrying about.

1. Settings we want attached to Global Settings (IE GumballLauncher settings). When we get access through the GlobalSettings class it lets us have multiple settings assets for the same type. 
Allowing us to easily swap out settings configurations while testing.

2. Singleton settings loaded from Resources folder (IE Level Builder settings). There should only be one asset for this setting type. 

Look at the different weapon settings and then the level builder settings to know what I'm talking about
